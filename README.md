## Design Patterns You Should Know (TypeScript)

A design pattern is a common solution to a particular problem in software architecture design.

### What is the design pattern consist of?

- the problem that the pattern solves
- motivation to solve the problem in the way that the pattern suggests
- structures of the classes that make up the solution
- example in one of the programming languages
- implementation features in different contexts
- connections with other patterns

### Pattern classification

Patterns differ in the level of complexity, detail, and coverage of the system being designed.

The most low-level and simple patterns are _idioms_. They are not universal, since they are applicable only within the framework of one programming language.

The most universal ones are _architectural patterns_ that can be implemented in almost any language. They are needed to design the entire program, and not its individual elements.

In addition, the design patterns differ in purpose. There are 3 main groups, described below:

- **Creation patterns** are concerned with the flexible creation of objects without introducing unnecessary dependencies into the program.
- **Structural patterns** show different ways of building connections between objects.
- **Behavioral patterns** take care of effective communication between objects.
