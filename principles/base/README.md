### Encapsulate What Varies.

Encapsulate code that changes a lot. This basic O-O principle you may not know as well, here is a brief overview. **If you push code deeper into classes and behind encapsulation boundaries the change is isolated, code is more maintainable.**

### Program to an interface.

Coding to interfaces **is a technique to write classes based on an interface**; interface that defines what the behavior of the object should be. It involves creating an interface first, defining its methods and then creating the actual class with the implementation.

### To favor composition over inheritance.

**The design principle that gives the design higher flexibility.** It is more natural to build business-domain classes out of various components than trying to find commonality between them and creating a family tree.
